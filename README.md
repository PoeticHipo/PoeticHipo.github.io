Div 1 Timer
Hello,
This is a Division 1 Speed Run timer. 
I had Google Gemini help me build.

Everything is local on your computer.

The "Export" button is just a text document with the full summary of the run. 

The "Purchase Cache" drop down menu will update and change depending on the number entered in the cost of the cache.

The "Credit Per Run" is defaulted to the amount for a Legendary Amherst with picking up both of the bosses GE credits. No GE modifier.

Thank you!
Enjoy and happy speed running!
